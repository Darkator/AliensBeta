[QUOTE]The North American B-25 Mitchell was an American twin-engined medium bomber manufactured by North American Aviation. It was used by many Allied air forces, in every theater of World War II, as well as many other air forces after the war ended, and saw service across four decades.

The B-25 was named in honor of General Billy Mitchell, a pioneer of U.S. military aviation. The B-25 is the only American military aircraft named after a specific person. By the end of its production, nearly 10,000 B-25s in numerous models had been built.  - Wikipedia[/QUOTE]

This download includes skins for Great Britain (with & without invasion stripes), China (communist - grey & white), China (Nationalist), Iran (a fictional one I made up), South Korea (also fictional), Mexico, Peru, and US.  Buttons are included for each skin.  The model is slightly different for the British version, it's in a different folder from the other.  Both British skins go with that file.



This unit uses the standard Bomber animations.  Buttons are included for each skin, when your adding the files the skin should be called, 'Eurofighter.dds.'

This version of the B25 is not the same as the earlier one floating around the forums - I'd created that a couple years back when I was still working on Modern Warfare for Warlords.  This one is way better, use this one!

ENJOY!
